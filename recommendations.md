# 🔐 Recommendations - Mitigating SYN Flood Attacks

To protect against future SYN flood attacks, the following mitigation strategies are recommended:

## 🛡️ Immediate Steps

- Block or rate-limit suspicious IP addresses at the firewall
- Monitor for abnormal traffic patterns in real time

## 🧰 Technical Controls

- **Enable SYN cookies**: Helps to mitigate half-open connections
- **Firewall filtering**: Drop invalid SYN packets or rate-limit SYN traffic
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Detect anomalous SYN patterns

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Hardening

- Use a reverse proxy or load balancer with built-in DoS protection
- Implement timeout and connection limit policies on web servers
- Employ cloud-based DDoS protection services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield)

## 🧪 Monitoring and Alerts

- Set up monitoring for SYN queue depth
- Alert thresholds for connection rates and unusual spikes

## ✅ Long-Term Strategy

- Conduct regular incident response drills
- Keep firewall and server software updated
- Educate staff on recognizing symptoms of DoS/DDoS events

Implementing these controls will help minimize risk and ensure high availability of critical web services.
